## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid blue (#4285F4) to convey trust and clarity in the interface. This choice leverages a classic association of blue with technology but aims for a more vibrant expression.
- Background color: Light blue-gray (#E8F0FE) to provide a clean, unobtrusive backdrop that enhances readability and focuses user attention on content.
- Accent color: Soft teal (#64B5CD) as a secondary accent to complement the primary blue, promoting a sense of calm and sophistication without competing for attention.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings to give a modern, techy, scientific feel; and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure readability.
- Use of grid-based layouts to maintain consistency across the app.
- Simple and recognizable icons from a consistent set (e.g., Material Design Icons) to ensure ease of understanding and interaction.
